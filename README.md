# Anomaly Detection for CPS With Multiplicative Noise Uncertainty
This repository contains the MATLAB code to simulate the anomaly detector design for a linear time varying system whose dynamics has both multiplicative and additive noises.

# Dependencies
- MATLAB (Preferrably 2019b or higher)
- SOS ToolBox
- SeDuMi solver

# Procedure to Run the Code
Please run `multi_noise_lcss.mlx` file after including the required toolboxes and solvers in the Matlab path.

## Variations in code
The variances of the multiplicative noises can be set through lines `240-244` in the `multi_noise_lcss.mlx` file.
